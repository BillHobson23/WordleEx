How To Play:
You will be shown a menu with 4 options at the start of the game.
These options are Create random (5 to 7) letter game and Create WOTD game.
Create WOTD game is the basic game where it will pick the word from the WOTD table in the database.

Letters can be input by clicking on the keyboard displayed under the grid or by typing in
using your real keyboard.

You have to pick a word to fill a single row. Row size will increase based on what gamemode you clicked.
After making a guess the letters will change color based on if it is in the correct place (green),
if it is in the word (yellow), if it is not in the word (gray).

After you have guessed correctly or run out of guesses statistics will appear on the screen
displaying number of games, wins and win rate.
After you have finished a game you will have to refresh the page to go back to the menu where
you can pick a gamemode and start playing again.

Added feature:
Create random 5,6,7 will first create the grid of size 5,6,7 and then you will need to input a word of that size
until you run out of guesses or you have correctly guessed.
Create random (5 to 7) letter game will pick a word from a seperate table in the database. The guess will be checked with a word within the same database to make sure its a proper word.

Create random (5 to 7) feature was made so the user can pick difficulties based on their skill level
or just based on what they feel like playing at the time and they can play as many times as they like in a day.
